1. application.py

Notice how it configures Jinja with a custom “filter,” usd, 
a function (defined in helpers.py) that will make it easier to 
format values as US dollars (USD). 

It then further configures Flask to store sessions on the 
local filesystem (i.e., disk) as opposed to storing them inside of 
(digitally signed) cookies, which is Flask’s default.


2. helpers.py
Given a symbol (e.g., NFLX, AAPL)

lookup function: returns a stock quote for a company in the form of 
a dict with three keys: 
- name (str)
- price (float)
- symbol (str) 
- a canonicalized (uppercase) version of a stock’s symbol, 
irrespective of how that symbol was capitalized when passed into lookup
